            <p class="par" >A gymnasium, also known as a <strong>"gym"</strong>, is an indoor location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient Greek term <i>"gymnasium"</i>.
                 They are commonlyfound in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
                  "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. <br>A "gym" may include or describe adjacent
                   open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts
                    for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>

                    <BR>I am very happy that my Master (Surya Fitness & Gym)had suggested me this diet. The program is easy to follow and 
                        motivation from my family really helped me. The first 2 weeks were a little difficult due to the reduction of intake daily
                         calories but the way the diet is set up made the transition easier. I learned to read and to pay attention to product labels
                          and now I am always choosing the healthier and less caloric ones. There are some easy replacements out there.
                           The most difficult part was to cut the snack and to reduce the portion I was eating.
